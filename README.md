My first issue was trying to get the main body of the site to be indented due to the side navigation being introduced. To fix this is put padding-left on the div tags so that everything that was put in a div was indented.

Next I wanted to put a CSS styling of a caption on my profile picture. This proved difficult as the styling didn’t work and the text and box wouldn’t work in the correct way. Eventually I had got it to a point where it was nearly there but the box where the text should appear was at the top of the picture and not at the bottom. This was an issue caused by the fact that I put the float: left on the image and not on the figure.

My next issue arisen when I tried to implement a Google Maps API. After following Google’s instructions, nothing showed up on the screen. After going through my code with a friend, they pointed out that the JavaScript was not linked properly and therefore was not picking up the code as I tried to link it using similar code to how I linked my CSS.
When trying to implement my slideshow I struggled to get what I was hoping for. The initial plan was to have slideshow that was captioned with the place I worked and what I did. However, after struggling with this code I changed my idea to have an automated slideshow of just images and a table to the side, which shows the information about the roles I did at each place.
The responsive design proved difficult as I tried to do it once I had put in all my content. This meant that I had to edit every element. The main changes in the responsive design is that the side navigation bar goes and turns into burger menu which pops out and allows the navigation options as before. This had many errors as it clashed with other CSS codes and therefore I had to manually find out all the clashes and fix it.
